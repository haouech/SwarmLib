An image processing project to detect edges based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique

The project can detect edges but still needs some enhancements.

The result is not bad so far, but we still have to use [Otsu's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method) to calculate the optimal edge threshold.

PS: This project is still under development.
Get back after few days to see some changes :) 
Thanks
